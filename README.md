# &#9836; MidiPlayerJS

MidiPlayerJS is a JavaScript library which reads standard MIDI files and emits JSON events in real time. This player does not generate any audio, but by attaching a handler to the event emitter you can trigger any code you like which could play audio, control visualizations, feed into a MIDI interface, etc.
